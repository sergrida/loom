## Description

LOOM is a collection of scripts, tools and tutorials that I use in the development of my creations. I create these tools by default with Bash, although I also use scripts from Node.js, Perl, Python and applications written in C.


## Install

To install LOOM use the `./ubuntu_2204_install.sh` script. I usually work with the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS operating system, so LOOM is made for this system.


## First steps
