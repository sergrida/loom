## Description

LOOM is a collection of scripts, tools and tutorials that I use in my developments. I create these tools by default with Bash, although I also use scripts from Node.js, Perl, Python and applications written in C.


## Install

To install LOOM use the `./ubuntu_2204_install.sh` script. I usually work with the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS operating system, so LOOM is made for this system.


## First steps

To use a LOOM script or application, use the `loom` command, followed by the address of the script and any required arguments. The address is relative to the `collections` folder and uses `.` to separate the folders and the script file. For example, to run the script with the address `collections/ubuntu/update.sh` use the command `ł ubuntu.update.sh`.

You can run the command shorthand, using `ł` and the shorthand address. For example, to run the example script above, use the `ł u.u` command.


## Information

Each of the scripts details its functionalities and actions it performs. To easily access the document, use the `loom read` command and the script address. For example, to access the script from the previous examples, use the command `ł re u.u`.
